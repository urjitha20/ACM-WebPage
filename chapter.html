            </p><br>
        <h3>ARTICLE III: MEMBERSHIP</h3><br>
            <p>
                The provisions of this section must conform to the membership
                provisions specified in ACMâ€™s Bylaws (Bylaw 5, Section 5; ACM
                Constitution Article 3). Membership in the Student Chapter shall be

                gender, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, economic status,
                veteran status, or parenthood.
            </p><br>
        <h3>ARTICLE IV: OFFICERS</h3>    <br>
            <p>
                The officers of this Chapter shall be: Chair, Vice Chair, and
                Treasurer. These individuals must be ACM Student Members. In addition,
                a Faculty Sponsor with an ACM Professional Membership is required.
                These officers constitute the Council. A minimum of three officers to
                establish a Chapter. Other officers may also be established. All
                required officers of the Chapter must be members of ACM. The officers
                shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual
                election meeting. They shall take office on January / 25 and serve for
                one year. [It is highly recommended that the Chapterâ€™s election be
                held at the last meeting in the fall with the new officers taking
                office in January. This provides for a period of transition from the
                outgoing Council to the incoming Council as well as providing
                continuity of management and planning over the summer. If your school
                operates on a quarter or trimester system, choose a timing that serves
                the same objectives. Appointment or nomination of an individual to an
                officer position within an ACM chapter shall be in general limited to
                two full consecutive terms in the same position. This recommendation
                is intended to encourage the continuing infusion of new volunteers
                into the organization and to encourage office holders to give thought
                to planning for their successor. Appointment or nomination to a third
                or subsequent consecutive term should be limited to situations where
                such appointment or nomination is believed to be in the best interests
                of the Association.
